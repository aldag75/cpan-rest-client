Running tests:

* the fast way:
  prove -lr t

* the slow way:
  dzil test

===

Making a release:

* You need Dist::Zilla installed.
* The git tree should be clean and on master. You may, e.g., 
  want to run "dzil clean".

* Edit lib/REST/Client.pm and increase the version number.
  Commit this with git.

* Edit Changes and add an entry for the new release.
  Don't commit it yet.

* Run "dzil release". This performs all the following steps:
  - builds a distribution tarball
  - runs the tests in its directory
  - asks for confirmation
  - uploads the tarball to CPAN
  - commits Changes
  - makes a git tag with the version number
  - git pushes master and its tags to origin (github)
